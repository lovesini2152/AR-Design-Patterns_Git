# AR Design Patterns (Unity Project)

This Unity project is part of an academic research initiative on **Head-Mounted Display (HMD)-based Augmented Reality interaction design patterns**, developed as part of a PhD research project.

## 🔍 Overview

The goal of this project is to create a reusable set of **interaction design patterns** and **Unity-based prefab modules** that support museum and cultural heritage experiences using AR glasses like HoloLens 2.

## ✨ Features

- Unity project configured for **AR Foundation** and **HoloLens 2**
- Modular prefabs implementing key interaction patterns:
  - Guiding users to points of interest
  - AR jigsaw puzzle and reassembly
  - AR exhibit drawing and feature highlighting
  - Environmental protection game (e.g., coral reef defense)
- Optimized for cultural heritage applications
- Git-structured project with `.gitignore` tailored for Unity

> Note: Other Unity-generated folders like `Library/` and `Logs/` are excluded via `.gitignore`.

## 🛠 Requirements

- Unity **2022.X** or later
- **AR Foundation**
- HoloLens 2 or compatible AR HMD
- Git (for version control)

## 📘 Research Background

This project is part of the doctoral research by **Yu Liu** (Hochschule RheinMain), aiming to:

- Define reusable interaction design patterns for AR  
- Support developers through a prefab-based approach  
- Enhance user experience in AR museum exhibitions
